# Micro:bit Automated Self Watering Plant

## Inspiration
Nowadays, people are very busy with their schedule and they do not take care of the plants. Most people are too lazy to water the potted plants on their rooftop gardens every day during summers. So, we have made a system which automatically waters the plant according to its need. 

## What it does
The soil moisture sensor used in our project senses the moisture level of the soil and if the moisture level is low, the plant is automatically watered according to its requirement. 

## How we built it

1) Micro: Bit

2) Soil Moisture Sensor

3) 3V Submersible Pump

4) M-M wire for connection as well as a battery to supply power to the micro: bit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our project because we have built a system that takes care of our environment which is very important in today's era.

## What we learned

We learned Micro: bit functionalities.

## What's next for Micro: bit Automated Self Watering Plant

We will try to make it more compact and effective.
